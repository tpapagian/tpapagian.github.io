Abstract
====
Many-core processors, due to their complexity and diversity, necessitate high-productivity, domain-specific approaches to parallel programming. These approaches should hide architectural details and low-level parallelization constructs, while enabling scalability and performance portability. This paper presents a scalable implementation of MapReduce, a runtime system used widely by domain-specific languages for large-scale data processing, on the Intel SCC. We address the scalability bottlenecks of MapReduce with data partitioning, combining and sorting algorithms that we customize for the SCC network on-chip architecture. We achieve linear or superlinear speedups for representative MapReduce workloads with data sets that fit on a single SCC node. We also show that the SCC node outperforms the IBM Cell QS22 Blade, when the latter uses the fastest implementation of MapReduce available for the Cell processor.

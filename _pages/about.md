I am a [Production Engineer](https://engineering.fb.com/category/production-engineering/) at [Facebook](https://about.facebook.com/), building reliable systems at scale. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/) at the [University of Crete](http://www.uoc.gr/), working with [Prof. Angelos Bilas](http://users.ics.forth.gr/~bilas/) in 2021. My dissertation focuses on reducing system overheads when accessing data on next-generation fast storage devices. During my doctoral studies, I was also a graduate research assistant in the [Computer Architecture and VLSI Systems (CARV) Laboratory](https://www.ics.forth.gr/carv/) of the [Institute of Computer Science (ICS)](https://www.ics.forth.gr/) at the [Foundation of Research and Technology â€” Hellas (FORTH)](https://www.forth.gr/). I received my Bachelor and Master degree in [Computer Science](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en) from the [University of Crete](https://en.uoc.gr/) in 2010 and 2013 respectively. 

I am honored that my work, during my doctoral studies, was awarded with the [Facebook Graduate Fellowship (2019-2021)](https://research.fb.com/announcing-the-2019-facebook-fellows-and-emerging-scholars/) in the [Compute Storage & Efficiency](https://research.fb.com/fellows/papagiannis-anastasios/) research team and the [Maria Michail Manasaki Doctoral Fellowship (2018)](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?custom=manasakis&lang=en).

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in the general area of computer systems. My  work during my doctoral studies focuses on the area of datacenter storage systems, especially in low-overhead access to fast storage devices (SSDs and NVM), where systems software overhead becomes a significant bottleneck in the I/O path. 

<!-- My recent work includes the design and implementation of key-value stores and the use of memory-mapped I/O for fast storage devices to improve processing density and infrastructure efficiency by reducing the number of CPU cycles required per operation. This work also incudes the optimization of memory-mapped I/O path inside the Linux kernel. -->
